# Lab 2.4

This is a GitHub page of my university task to analyse the **Twitter API**.

___

There is a **Task2** directory in this repository, it contains a program for the second task of the lab. The other files, including:
 - flask_app.py
 - twitter_mapper.py
 - locations.py
 - not_hidden.py

are all a part of Task 3.

*flask_app.py* is the main file, run it if you ever need to.
